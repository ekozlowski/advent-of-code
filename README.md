# Advent Of Code

Tracking my participation in 2020's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
also going back and doing some [historical puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/events)

## Programming Language

I will attempt to use Go for all programming tasks, since I'm not familiar with
it enough.

I'll probably solve a few in Python too, just for fun.
